(1, '<p>With all the noise around how there’ll probably never be a second season of Watchmen this week, I figured I should finally get around to writing about Watchmen since it’s been weeks since it wrapped up.</p><p>There was a ton I liked about the series: the show within a show; the oddball, barely explained side characters; the way it reframes some of the graphic novel’s biggest ideas. The Hooded Justice episode, in particular, was worth watching the entire season for. That hour is perhaps a better encapsulation of the show than the entirety of the show, and it feels so true to the book that it hardly seems like it wasn’t in there in the first place.</p><p>I did find the series’ structure a little frustrating, though. Very little actually happens during the timeline of the show — there’s a murder, some flashbacks, and then the ending arrives. Nearly everything important occurred before the show started, and we just have to wait for characters to reveal to us what they’ve already done. Those twists and turns add up to something interesting, I just wish it had felt a little more like that scheming was happening in the present, rather than like we were waiting for a “republic serial villain” to lay things out for us when the time is right.</p><p>Check out seven trailers from this week below.</p><p></p><p>BLACK WIDOW</p><p>Marvel put out a short new teaser for Black Widow this week. It includes a lot of the same footage as the first trailer, so there’s not too much to see here. But for those eager for spoilers, it also includes a first glimpse at the film’s villain, Taskmaster. The movie comes out May 1st.</p><p>MORBIUS</p><p>The first second of this trailer features a ripped, shirtless vampire, just in case you were wondering what kind of movie this is going to be. Morbius is Sony’s latest attempt to expand its universe of Spider-Man films. While I’m utterly unmoved by everything I’m seeing here, there is one fun little twist: Michael Keaton. He appears for a split second at the end of the trailer, suggesting he’s reprising his role from Spider-Man: Homecoming. Morbius comes out July 31st.</p><p>SNOWPIERCER</p><p>After the success of Bong Joon-ho’s film adaptation in 2013, Snowpiercer is being turned into a series for TNT. It’s a strange world that leaves a lot of room for exploration, so I’m curious to see where this goes. For now, though, the imagery all looks really similar to what appeared in the film. The show debuts May 31st.</p><p>GUNS AKIMBO</p><p>Daniel Radcliffe plays an internet troll who gets guns bolted onto his hands and is forced to participate in an online reality show death match. I really cannot offer a comment beyond that. It comes out March 5th</p><p>NEXT IN FASHION</p><p>Netflix keeps adding more and more reality shows, and Next In Fashion looks like an easy winner. The Project Runway-esque series gives Queer Eye fans another place to watch Tan France, who co-hosts with Alexa Chung. The series debuts January 29th.</p><p>DISPATCHES FROM ELSEWHERE</p><p>AMC has a mysterious new series coming up from Jason Segel. It’s hard to explain just what’s going on here — the whole thing looks a little bit like Netflix’s Maniac, a little bit like a Michel Gondry film, and a little bit like a mishmash of every show about some dark global conspiracy. Point being, you should at least check this out for a moment to see what it’s like — plus, it co-stars André 3000. The show debuts March 1st.</p><p>VEROTIKA</p><p>The Misfits’ Glenn Danzig directed a horror movie. It is his directorial debut.

(3, '<p>Early Saturday morning, SpaceX plans to launch a Falcon 9 rocket from Florida that will most likely break apart in midair just a few minutes after takeoff. The rocket’s demise is part of a planned test flight that’s supposed to demonstrate SpaceX’s ability to handle a catastrophic failure of one of its vehicles. If the test goes well, SpaceX will be closer than ever to putting people on its Falcon 9 rocket for the first time this year.</p><p>Known as the in-flight abort test, this is one of the last major milestones that SpaceX must meet as part of NASA’s Commercial Crew program. It’s a government initiative aimed at developing new American-made spacecraft to launch NASA astronauts from the US once again. For the last six years, SpaceX has been developing a new capsule called the Crew Dragon for the program, designed to fly on top of the company’s Falcon 9 rocket and transport NASA astronauts to and from the International Space Station. As part of the development process, SpaceX has had to do a number of demonstrations to show that its vehicle is both safe and capable of doing the job.</p><p>SPACEX’S BACKUP PLAN IF A TRIP TO THE ISS STARTS TO GO SOUTH</p><p>Saturday’s test is all about showcasing SpaceX’s backup plan in the rare event that a trip to the ISS starts to go south. Let’s say one of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rockets starts to break apart during the ascent to space. NASA wants to know that its astronauts riding inside the Crew Dragon can still be brought home safely, despite a malfunctioning rocket.</p><p>To save passengers during an emergency, SpaceX designed its Crew Dragon with an escape system. Embedded within the outer hull of the capsule are eight thrusters, called SuperDraco engines. If some kind of issue arises during flight, it will trigger the thrusters to fire. The engines will then carry the Crew Dragon up and away from the dangerous rocket. Once the capsule is far enough away, the Crew Dragon will deploy its four parachutes, and lower itself down gently into the Atlantic Ocean, where the crew will await rescue.</p><p>SpaceX has tested its emergency thrusters before, but this will be the first time the company tries the entire escape process midflight. About a minute and a half after the Falcon 9 launches, the Crew Dragon’s SuperDraco engines will fire and the capsule will separate from the rocket. At the same time, the Falcon 9’s main engines will stop firing, and the rocket will eventually fall back to Earth. As the Crew Dragon attempts a gentle landing in the ocean, the Falcon 9 will be torn apart as it descends into the water. The timing of the breakup depends on how windy it is on Saturday, as well as other factors like the rocket’s position, according to NASA. SpaceX has assembled a team of people to recover the debris from the rocket when the test is over. The Falcon 9 that’s meeting its end has already been to space and back three times before, making this fourth trip its last.</p><p>All in all, it could provide for a spectacular show on the ground for those in Cape Canaveral, Florida, where the test is taking place. At a minute and a half after launch, the Falcon 9 won’t terribly far from its launch site at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, so it’s possible the rocket’s destruction will be seen by bystanders near the launch area. In fact, a popular beach that many attend to watch rockets launch from the Cape will be closed, due to the slightest concern that debris might land there.</p><p>Even though no people will be on board the Crew Dragon during this test, SpaceX will send its recovery boat to meet the capsule, just as it would if there was an actual emergency. SpaceX has its own boat with a helicopter landing pad, designed to recover the Crew Dragon whenever it lands in the ocean — either when it returns from the ISS normally or during an emergency scenario. The Air Force will also be helping SpaceX out with these recovery efforts.</p><p>NASA AND SPACEX WILL BE WATCHING THIS TEST CLOSELY</p><p>NASA and SpaceX will be watching this test closely, especially since the emergency abort system on the Crew Dragon has been problematic in the past. In April, a test version of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon exploded in Florida during testing of the SuperDraco engines. The company had been igniting the engines in a series of burns, and a leaky valve caused a chain reaction of events that led the vehicle to burst apart. SpaceX investigated the failure for months and ultimately made a few design changes in the system. And in November, the company successfully fired up the SuperDracos on the Crew Dragon capsule set to fly on Saturday, showing that they worked as expected. Still, nerves will be high this weekend as both NASA and SpaceX witness how the system performs in a simulated emergency scenario.</p><p>If all goes well, then the next flight milestone for SpaceX is to put people on board the Crew Dragon. Two NASA astronauts, Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley, are slated to be the first passengers in the Crew Dragon, tasked with flying to the station for a quick, two-week stay. If that flight goes well, then NASA will eventually certify the Crew Dragon to do routine crewed flights to the ISS and back.</p><p>The schedule for that crewed flight hasn’t been nailed down yet, as there is still a lot of work to do once this in-flight abort test is complete. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk noted that the Crew Dragon that will carry Behnken and Hurley could arrive at Cape Canaveral in February, but that it could take a few more months to do all the necessary processing and tests before the astronauts can fly.</p><p>Figuring out the date of that crewed flight will be a major moment for both SpaceX and NASA. Since the retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2011, all of NASA’s astronauts have been flying on Russia’s Soyuz rocket to get to the ISS. The first crewed flight for the Commercial Crew program will return human spaceflight to American soil once again. Additionally, NASA astronauts have long launched on government-owned vehicles, but SpaceX’s Crew Dragon is a commercially developed spacecraft. When people ride on board, it may be the first time that a private capsule transports people to orbit.</p><p>IF ALL GOES WELL, THEN THE NEXT FLIGHT MILESTONE FOR SPACEX IS TO PUT PEOPLE ON BOARD</p><p>Of course, rival company Boeing might get there first. Boeing is also part of the Commercial Crew program and has been developing its own crew capsule called the CST-100 Starliner. That vehicle made its debut flight to space in December, though a glitch during the mission prevented the Starliner from reaching the space station like it was supposed to. It’s possible the company may have to do another uncrewed flight test because of the mishap. But even with the glitch, Boeing is also nearing its first crewed test which will carry two NASA astronauts and a Boeing astronaut to the station.</p><p>Which crewed mission happens first still depends on how schedules play out this year, and the Commercial Crew program is fairly notorious for delays. But both SpaceX and Boeing are closer than ever to flying people in their vehicles, and Saturday’s launch will be a big thing to remove from SpaceX’s to-do list.</p><p>The in-flight abort is scheduled to get underway at 8AM ET on Saturday, though SpaceX has a four-hour window to do the test. So far, weather is looking pretty great, with a 90 percent chance of good conditions. NASA plans to do a pre-launch briefing at 1PM ET on Friday, January 17th, with live coverage starting at 7:45AM ET. Check back then to see SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket get destroyed on purpose.</p>\r\n', 'SpaceX will destroy one of its rockets in the pursuit of safety this weekend\r\n', 'The company is demonstrating how it will handle a failure\r\n', '2020-01-16', '10:00:00', 4, 2),
(4, '<p>Much like competitors HBO Max and Disney+, Comcast’s streaming service, Peacock, is going to be entirely reliant on hubs.</p><p>Comcast and NBCUniversal gave an in-depth look at Peacock, which launches on July 15th and will come with three different pricing tiers, during a special investors event this afternoon at 30 Rock in New York City. There are more than 600 engineers working on the platform, according to Matt Strauss, head of Peacock. The streaming platform is based on the infrastructure that Sky in the UK has used for its own streaming options.</p><p>During the presentation, Strauss walked investors and viewers through the Peacock interface. There are three different areas that subscribers can use when they open the app: channels, trending, and browse. While people are thinking of which option they want to click on, a video will play automatically. It may be the news, or part of a game, or a show, but the idea is that “when you launch it immediately starts playing video, just like TV,” Strauss said. The first image in the gallery below shows an example from a story about Meghan Markle and Prince Harry from NBC News Now.</p><p>Once people open up browse, they’ll be able to cycle through the 15,000+ TV episodes and movies available to stream. These are broken down into a series of rows similar to Netflix and Disney+. The first two rows are based on shows that people are already watching (“Continue Watching”) and new additions to the Peacock app.</p><p>As viewing habit data is collected, machine learning algorithms will help to make titles that appear on the homepage more personalized. This is how Netflix operates and how the upcoming HBO Max app will operate as well. Emphasis will then be placed on Peacock Originals in subsequent rows, followed with recommendations for existing titles that might be of interest. Peacock will also come with a kids section, like every other streaming app, that is entering the streaming space this year.</p><p>PEACOCK IS GOING TO TRY TO REPLICATE THE LOOK OF TRADITIONAL TELEVISION</p><p>Then there’s the trending section. Peacock will also offer short-form content on a daily basis, including sports highlights, pop culture updates, and shorter news segments. Late-night clips, for example, will have a home in this section. This includes Saturday Night Live clips that people may have missed — Strauss referred to it as the ability to get rid of the “FOMO” (fear of missing out) you might experience by missing a late-night episode right when it airs. This can help NBCUniversal pull subscribers away from YouTube, where many of these highlights already live after the live airing, and over to Peacock — if everything goes according to plan.</p><p>The third section is channels. NBC is a linear network that wants to remind people how important television is, so Peacock is designed to try to replicate the look of traditional television, Strauss says. Subscribers can pull up a channel guide to scroll through, much like we already do with cable packages now, and see what’s on. They can select from TV shows, news, sports, and movies, as well as look into specific types of content hubs. A Saturday Night Live hub, for example, will also get a “channel” look for people to browse through if they like.</p><p>These are Peacock’s three sections, but there are more product features like curation around specific shows. For instance, fans of NBC’s The Office will be able to go into that show’s dedicated hub and then select from a character like Michael or Jim and watch episodes that are centric to those characters, or are seen as some of the best. There are “beginner” options that give new viewers a chance to figure out the best episodes to watch, too. This is a type of human curation WarnerMedia is using to try to market its upcoming competitor HBO Max.</p><p>More of the Peacock interface, including a look at some of the profile avatar options that will be available, can be seen in the gallery above.</p>\r\n', 'Here’s what NBC’s Peacock streaming service will look like when it launches this July\r\n', 'The feeling of live TV comes to streaming\r\n', '2020-01-16', '05:43:00', 4, 4),

Along with the LP news, Sawayama has shared her new song “Comme des Garçons (Like the Boys).” Hear it below. Scroll down for the album cover, tracklist (which includes the single “STFU!”), and Sawayama’s upcoming tour schedule.</p><p>Sawayama said of “Commes des Garçons (Like the Boys)” in a statement:</p><p>When I was writing this song I wanted on one hand to lyrically explore the idea of people having to adopt negative male tropes to appear confident, whilst on the other sonically paying homage to the early 2000s dance tracks that made me feel confident. The idea that the socially acceptable version of confidence is in acting “like the boys,” otherwise as a woman you get called a bitch—but in the club, we reclaim the word “bitch” as a sign of ultimate confidence (“yes bitch,” “work bitch”). I wanted to sit these two together and make a club fashion banger that makes you feeling like THAT bitch whoever you are.</p><p>Rina Sawayama recorded SAWAYAMA in London and Los Angeles. She worked on the album with Danny L Harle, Clarence Clarity, Bram Inscore, Nate Company, Nicole Morier, Lauren Aquilina, and Johnny Latimer. She said of the record:</p><p>The album ultimately is about family and identity. It’s about understanding yourself in the context of two opposing cultures (for me British and Japanese), what “belonging” means when home is an evolving concept, figuring out where you sit comfortably within and awkwardly outside of stereotypes, and ultimately trying to be ok with just being you, warts and all.</p><p>Check out Pitchfork’s “The 20 Best Pop and R&B Albums of 2017,” featuring Sawayama’s mini-album RINA at No. 19.</p>\r\n', 'Rina Sawayama Announces Tour and Debut Album, Shares New Song: Listen\r\n', '“Comme des Garçons (Like the Boys)” is the second offering from the London pop artist’s SAWAYAMA\r\n', '2020-01-16', '04:00:00', 3, 3),
(6, '<p>Mac Miller’s death from an accidental drug overdose sent ripples across the rap community he helped cultivate. He was a kind-hearted collaborator and invested heavily in others’ growth, but his musical arc was left unfinished. In August of 2018, he put out Swimming, an album that was like a quantum leap in self-discovery. Then, a month later, at 26, he was gone, unable to realize that potential. Now there’s Circles, a posthumously released Swimming companion piece that gives his years of work a bit of closure. It’s the culmination of a career spent improving, a fitting epilogue to an aspirational life.</p><p>Miller had worked closely on early versions of these songs with composer-producer Jon Brion, who was committed to finishing the album after Miller’s death. It’s unclear how deep Miller was into the process at the time of his passing, but this sounds like a completed work, or as complete as it can be. “This is a complicated process that has no right answer. No clear path,” his family wrote in a letter on his Instagram. “We simply know that it was important to Malcolm for the world to hear it.”</p><p>If Swimming wasn’t Miller’s best album, it was certainly the one where he came into his own as an artist. There are moments on 2015’s GO:OD AM where his rapping is sharpest, 2014’s Faces accommodated his most ambitious ideas, and 2016’s The Divine Feminine is his most diverse and complete project, a testament to the community of musicians he’d established around him. But Swimming hinted at an artist who’d finally cleared his mind and found his footing. Circles provides some resolution and helps finish Miller’s final thoughts.</p><p>Miller seemed to envision Circles as the completion of a loop. “My god, it go on and on/Just like a circle, I go back to where I’m from,” he rapped on Swimming closer “So It Goes.” That record was about being fine on the surface while struggling with anxiety; this one is about knowing there’s something to be done about it. Both records are about working through depression, how the bad days are long and the good days feel fleeting, but the tone is more optimistic here. The imagery of a cluttered mind is a near-constant in Miller’s final songs. On the plucked single “Good News,” he likens the recovery process to spring cleaning, which feels fitting for someone looking to hit the refresh button. “Sometimes I get lonely/Not when I’m alone/But it’s more when I’m standin’ in crowds that I’m feelin’ the most on my own,” he raps on “Surf,” a poignant realization for someone who spent his last years surrounded by throngs of fans. But it comes with an epiphany, a sort of thesis for the album: “And I know that somebody knows me/I know somewhere, there’s home/I’m startin’ to see that all I have to do is get up and go.”</p><p>Circles never really opens up into a full-fledged rap album, content to push back and forth between lo-fi beat music and singer-songwriter indie folk, working almost entirely with live arrangements. After doing his most-ever singing on Swimming, he crosses a threshold into doing almost no rapping on Circles. That was the entire idea: two albums bringing balance to each other. The few songs that do have raps in them display his love of the form and improvement as a writer. On “Hand Me Downs,” he raps about moving carelessly and stumbling through the same patterns. “Hands,” the only full rap song, works through negativity while displaying the subtly knotty lyricism he fell in love with as a teenager.</p><p>Miller was always trying to balance being the guy who started Facebook’s first Big L fan page with his love for the nakedness of 1970’s John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band. He didn’t live long enough to get to really reconcile those sides of himself, but as halves of a complete work, Swimming and Circles come the closest. Together, they establish the rapper-producer as comfortable in his skin, no longer out to prove to naysayers he could bar out. These are mellow, relaxed songs in search of that exact state of being. “‘Fore I start to think about the future/First can I please get through a day/Without any complications,” he sings on “Complicated.” It’s more Plastic Ono Band than Lifestylez ov da Poor & Dangerous—lots of guitars, some keys, light bass, the occasional synth line—but not beholden to any one sound.</p><p>The chill-out aesthetic won’t come as a surprise to those familiar with Mac Miller’s Space Migration Tour, which transformed the songs in his catalog with warm Internet-laced grooves from their days futzing with electronica and experimental jazz. He was a huge rap nerd but he also loved the prospect of playing with a live band. These songs feel like an attempt to smooth down his interests into something comprehensive, and Brion seems like the perfect person to usher them to completion. He serves as a co-producer on most songs, an additional producer on all the others, and his work makes the songs shapelier without compromising Miller’s vision for them.</p><p>When a young rapper dies too soon, fans start listening to their music much more closely, combing over their lyrics to find the writing on the wall. With Miller, you don’t have to dive too deeply. “God Speed” is rife with thoughts about going down a destructive path and on “Brand Name,” he wrote a disclaimer that proved tragically prescient: “To everyone who sell me drugs/Don’t mix it with that bullshit, I’m hopin’ not to join the 27 Club.” But Circles dispels any sense of fatalism in his music. He was still idealistic; in these songs, he is searching for a way to break the cycle, a way forward. It’s only appropriate that Mac Miller’s final musical act be one of self-reformation.</p>\r\n', '\"Mac Miller\r\nCircles\"\r\n', 'The first posthumous album from Mac Miller plays like a companion piece to Swimming.

(7, '<p>Why would anyone want to walk into a GameStop in 2020?</p><p>The venerable video game retailer is currently cratering, with overall sales for the holiday quarter down 25% year over year. The company had announced it would be closing as many as 200 stores last year after a series of disastrous quarters, and that was before its dismal holiday performance was announced. The news has been bad for a while, and it’s only getting worse.</p><p>GameStop’s executives believe that things will turn around when Sony and Microsoft release new consoles, but I’m not particularly optimistic about the company’s chances. My biggest problem with GameStop doesn’t have anything to do with pricing or the schedule of hardware or software. It’s that shopping inside a GameStop itself is a miserable experience.</p><p>WHAT WENT WRONG?</P><P>GameStop offers a series of services that few other retailers can match, much less beat. You can trade in your games for other games or get cash right then, without waiting to be paid out by online services like Amazon or eBay.</p><p>You can pay for your subscription services with cash by buying prepaid cards if you don’t have a credit or debit card or don’t want to use it online. GameStop’s stores are physical places you can visit to do your business instantly and directly, and that’s a considerable strength, even as so much of the video game industry moves online.</p><p>The problem is that walking into a GameStop feels like stepping into a flea market managed by employees who have already given up. The games are often heavily stickered, and many are missing the official cover on the case. Random assortments of toys and overpriced collectibles spill out over displays, with little rhyme or reason about where things are.</p><p>I WANT TO KNOW IF THEY HAVE A GAME I WANT TO BUY, AND I’D LIKE A YES OR NO ANSWER TO SEE IF MY TIME IS BEING WASTED.</p><p>You can spend a lot of money for replica items from your favorite game, anime, or movie universes, as long as you don’t mind it being a little beaten up by the time it gets to you. That’s also assuming the person behind the counter is willing to get the item you’re looking at down from the top shelves that ring the store, and anything up there is likely to be covered in dust. So many aspects of the shopping experience feel cheap, and so much of the stock feels neglected.</p><p>It makes me sad every time I have to go in one to pick up something I need that day, and it’s so uncomfortable, with the stock often being in such bad shape, that I’ll try to go to a Target or Walmart if possible. Heck, I get sad even typing that sentence; I worked at Electronics Boutique, and later EB Games, and finally GameStop when the companies merged, and I don’t remember it being that bad back then. Which isn’t to say it was ever good, just that everyone involved in running the stores, based on my anecdotal experiences shopping in them, seems to have given up.</p><p>The rest of my complaints are nothing new, but continue to rankle. The most likely answer to the question about whether they have a game in stock is another question: Did you pre-order? Sometimes they have a copy for walk-ins even if you didn’t pre-order, other times they don’t, and I’ll be told that if I want to guarantee a copy of the game I should have given them money to hold it. In which case I walk across the street to any other store to buy the game, without a pre-order.</p><p>It tends to go like this:</p><p>Ben: Do you have a copy of the new Assassin’s Creed game?</p><p>GameStop: Did you pre-order?</p><p>Ben: No, but ...</p><p>GameStop: If you want to make sure we have a copy of the game, you need to be sure to put $5 down to pre-order, which guarantees you ...</p><p>Ben: OK, but do you have a copy of the game?</p><p>GameStop: Do you have anything you’d like to trade in toward the cost of the game?</p><p>Ben: I still don’t know if you have it!</p><p>GameStop: Would you be interested in a pre-owned copy?</p><p>The pre-order question served as an answer about what’s in stock highlights why GameStop is in such trouble: Every interaction in the store is meant to serve GameStop’s interests, not the customer’s. I want to know if they have a game I want to buy, and I’d like a yes or no answer to see if my time is being wasted.</p><p>Ditching the script and answering a question with information is often quite literally against store policy, and could lead to disciplinary action or the loss of the job. I’m not asking for anyone to risk their livelihood to provide basic customer service, even though that should be the priority of those store policies to begin with. GameStop has a history of forcing employees to choose between helping the customers and going along with corporate policy.</p><p>GameStop, as a company, makes it very hard to get answers to basic questions, but it’s very easy to learn about all of GameStop’s high-margin services I’m not interested in, and have nothing to do with my visit.</p><p>WHERE DOES THIS LEAVE US? MISERABLE WORKERS, MISERABLE CUSTOMERS</P><P>The result of all that wasted time is I try to avoid GameStop whenever possible. I don’t expect the clerks there to know that I worked for the company for years a few decades ago, and I certainly don’t expect them to know that I write about video games for a living by sight.</p><p>What I do or don’t know as a customer is immaterial, because in my experience all GameStop customers are treated roughly the same. Our questions aren’t answered, our games are opened, beaten up, and covered in stickers, and we should have pre-ordered, and we’re going to have to step over a sad pile of Funko Pops before we have the opportunity to have our questions ignored.</p><p>I don’t think GameStop has much of a chance, even with the new consoles coming in 2020.

(12, '<p>The visual realism in Makoto Shinkai’s anime feature film Weathering With You is nothing short of stunning. Shinkai’s follow-up to his international hit Your Name keeps the warm, bright visuals, but adds even more detail, to the point where it rivals Studio Ghibli’s films for richness. This is the kind of movie where sharp-eyed viewers can pick out the individual crimp marks on the end of squeeze-tube toiletries, or the tiny moss spots that give an aging sidewalk its texture. Metal signs have photorealistic rust streaks. A hotel rate card on an unremarkable background wall is so meticulously drawn, you can read the pricing structure for services. You can count the individual leaves on shrubs as the characters walk by. The setting feels almost excruciatingly real, like a vivid sort of reality-plus.</p><p>It’s also a movie about a magical girl who creates sunshine by praying.</p><p>The thematic clash between a sublimely rendered but familiar mundane world and a unknowable preternatural element defines a lot of the conflict in Weathering With You. There’s no villain in this movie, and barely anything resembling an enemy that can be faced or fought. There’s just a sense that neither of the protagonists entirely belongs in such a quotidian world. Shinkai’s version of Tokyo is too beautiful to feel entirely ordinary, but it’s still so thoroughly realized that it’s solid and fixed, in a way the characters never are. And to some degree, the world knows they don’t fit in this setting, and responds to them as implacably as nature always does.</p><p>The central story develops slowly. Sixteen-year-old Hodaka Morishima (Kotaro Daigo in the original Japanese version; Brandon Engman in GKIDS’ English-language dub) runs away from his isolated island home and arrives in Tokyo with a battered face and a carefully calculated budget. Along the way, he nearly has a serious accident, but he’s saved by a vaguely sketchy man named Suga (Shun Oguri/Lee Pace). Trying to live on his own in Tokyo, Hodaka finds he can’t get legal work without a student ID. As his savings dry up, he reluctantly renews ties with Suga, moves into his office, and becomes a gofer for his tiny freelance writing business, alongside Suga’s lively associate, Natsumi Suga (Tsubasa Honda/Alison Brie).</p><p>Assigned to a project to write about urban legends, Natsumi and Hodaka run around Tokyo, chasing lurid supernatural tales that Hodaka contemptuously dismisses as “fantasy novel-like stuff.” But one confident psychic tells them a story that becomes relevant, about sunshine girls and rain girls, who are possessed by gods and can change the weather with their presence. For a seeming fable, the story feels unusually relevant: Tokyo is being battered with record-breaking, unseasonable rain, and its residents are eager for even a hint of sun. When Hodaka meets a teenage orphan named Hina (Nana Mori/Ashley Boettcher), who appears to be genuinely capable of breaking the clouds and ending the rain in a small area for a short period, he quickly suggests they go into business. Joined by Hina’s little brother, they set up a website and start selling Hina’s powers online, bringing quick bursts of sunshine to people trying to enjoy their outdoor fairs or weddings.</p><p>In a more American story, the idea of leveraging a spiritual blessing for financial gain would be horrific hubris, and would come at a terrible price. But Weathering With You is a much warmer, homier story, and one far more suited to Japanese culture. There’s a familiar metaphor at work in Hina’s “sunshine girl” powers, which draw on the Japanese obsession with youthful energy and good cheer. It isn’t hard to make the leap from Hina’s upbeat personality spreading light and warmth around her to the more literal sunbeams that follow her around.</p><p>That warmth is especially effective on Hodaka. Like Your Name, Weathering With You is a tragic love story about two young people gradually discovering their need for each other under strange, desperate circumstances. Weathering With You focuses more on Hodaka’s perspective; for all his independence in leaving home, he’s still shy and awkward, and Shinkai finds the humor in Hodaka’s delirious terror at entering a girl’s apartment for the first time, or trying to figure out how to declare his love.</p><p>And where Hodaka seems to desperately need Hina, to the exclusion of nearly everything else, Hina’s needs are more complicated, since she has a brother to look after, a job and household to manage on her own, and a gradually emerging price to pay for her powers. Where Weathering With You most falters is in Shinkai’s failure to make Hina much more than an idealized fantasy figure. She’s a polestar for Hodaka’s world, and a gift to Tokyo’s residents, but she isn’t much of a personality in her own right. The way she bears most of the story’s pain and pressure, while the focus is still on Hodaka’s yearning for her, can feel uncomfortably unbalanced.</p><p>Weathering With You also introduces a handful of strangely specific elements that it never fully explores, at least in the subtitled version. Hodaka is first seen with his face covered in adhesive bandages, as if he’d been injured. The natural assumption, given that he’s a runaway, is that he’s fleeing abuse at home, after some climactic incident. But when asked about his choice to leave home, he defers with a mild shrug of a statement about finding it repressive, and it never comes up again. Early in the film, Hodaka finds a loaded handgun, seemingly left in a dead drop for someone who hasn’t picked it up. The film never addresses who it belongs to, and Hodaka’s reasoning for hanging onto it, even after it causes him considerable trouble, is never fully articulated.</p><p>And Shinkai goes out of his way to establish Hodaka’s fascination with rain — that inciting accident at the beginning of the film happens because when he’s warned of a dangerous downpour coming, he runs into it, rather than away from it. Later, traversing the city behind Natsumi on her scooter, he raises his face to the rain in seeming bliss. And yet he never really talks about that part of himself, even in the face of a story that centers on the damaging and dangerous effects of rain, and the misery it brings an immense number of people.</p><p>But none of these threads matter much amid the movie’s heady, romantic sweep, which centers on the swooning emotions of young love. Hodaka and Hina have a ready-made Romeo and Juliet scenario going for them, in that they’re both underage, and most of the adults who notice them trying to live independently either try to exploit them or take them into custody. Shinkai never acknowledges that these kids might not be equipped to live on their own yet; he gives the story over fully into their perspective, where they have everything they need in each other, and just want to be left alone. The triumphant music of Japanese band Radwimps, which also scored Your Name, underlines that feeling of youthful, confident energy, with bursts of joyous uplift at key moments along the way.</p><p></p><p>And nothing in Weathering With You’s minor flaws interferes with the film’s melancholy beauty, which particularly lands whenever Hina engages her powers. The film’s near-constant rainfall is as exquisitely rendered as its cityscapes or its cozy, overpacked, but well-organized rooms. Every falling drop of water has its own highlights and shadows, and the clouds look like they drifted in from a Maxfield Parrish painting. But the moments when the rain clears are magical, not just literally, within the story, but in their glorious execution. There’s a repeated image throughout the film, as someone holds a hand up toward the sunlight, and looks at how the light illuminates their skin and makes it glow. In those moments, the audience can almost feel the weight and heat of the sunbeams.</p><p>Weathering With You is clearly channeling anxieties about climate change, though Shinkai keeps the image metaphorical and spiritual rather than digging into the real-world causes. The environment is out of balance in Weathering With You, and while it threatens Tokyo with grey, miserable days and eventually with storms and flooding, it threatens Hodaka and Hina in a much more personal way. In a film so obsessed with the fine line between childhood and adulthood, and with the ways grown-ups oppress and control people on the wrong side of that line, the message about the next generation paying the price for this generation’s decisions about pollution is entirely clear. That makes Weathering’s surprising, daring ending even more symbolic.</p><p>But while that ending seems ready-made for debate and discussion, and while it’s possible to pick the story apart and find some dubious elements, the real joy of Weathering With You is in the sensual pleasure of stepping into this world with Hodaka and Hina, and reveling both in their personal joys, and in the more mundane ones of the world around them. This is the kind of film where viewers can let themselves flow with the film’s emotion, or entirely ignore the action, and just get lost in the beauty of the imagination. Either way, it’s a luscious trip to take.</p>\r\n', 'Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary begins beta testing on PC next month\r\n', '343 will be sending out invitations; here’s how to get one\r\n', '2020-03-19', '11:05:00', 1, 2),

But Waititi, having helmed a hugely successful Marvel film and coming off fresh from directing the well-received finale of Disney+ hit The Mandalorian, is certainly a strong contender to carry the Star Wars flame forward.</p><p>Disney and Lucasfilm are also in need of some new, high-profile talent after Game of Thrones showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss quit their Star Wars trilogy to work on exclusive projects for Netflix. The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson is also reportedly working on a sequel to his Oscar nominated mystery thriller Knives Out that may complicate Disney’s separate plans to give another trilogy to Johnson, although the director and writer said this week that he is still in talks to helm more Star Wars projects in the future.</p><p>TAIKA WAITITI IS A LIKELY CANDIDATE TO HELP CARRY STAR WARS FORWARD</p><p>Waititi has worked closely before with Marvel’s superstar producer and studio president Kevin Feige, who’s working on his Star Wars movie now following the end of the current Marvel Infinity Saga. The New Zealand filmmaker is also now in the orbit of Jon Favreau, the Iron Man director who created and executive produced The Mandalorian and is now partly in charge of overseeing the future of Star Wars across streaming TV and the big screen.</p><p>All this would appear to point to a fruitful relationship between Waititi and the current masterminds of the Star Wars universe, so long as Waititi is interested. He was responsible for revitalizing the Thor series after its first two middling installments, turning actor Chris Hemsworth’s character into one of the most dynamic and funny elements of the MCU and opening the door to giving Thor huge roles to play in Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame. Disney and Lucasfilm may be looking for a similar breath of fresh air for Star Wars.</p><p>Then again, Waititi has a very full plate at the moment.

Absolutely not.</p><p>As soon as I set up shop, I made sure to set the right tone with my new friends.</p><p>I make sure to regularly check in with my villagers, ensuring that we keep that early rapport going. Communication is important.</p><p>In these early days, nearly every fish and bug I catch is of interest to the museum’s curator, Blathers. I donate the fish en masse, because they hold no interest to me. But I lovingly hand Blathers each bug, one by one, and relish in his squawking and panic. I make him tell me about every single insect. No exceptions. When I captured a Man-Faced Stink Bug, I cackled and immediately raced off to the museum to wake Blathers up. Hey, buddy, guess what I found? He hated it. It was fantastic.</p><p>My first villager, Hamlet the hamster, is a pretty cool guy. Every time I go to chat him up, he wants to tell me about how much he’s been working out. He beat my husband Aaron at basketball, he brags. His muscles glisten with sweat. He’s going for a run. I humor him and his constant fitness-based chatter. We go for walks together and sit by the lake. He even taught me how to make a really sweet honeycomb floor! At Nook’s Cranny, I saw a gift that immediately brought him to mind. So, I bought the hamster cage and took it to my big hamster friend’s feet.</p><p>He put on a smile, but I knew he was shaken. I had exposed the Goofy and Pluto paradox of Animal Crossing. He wasn’t so far apart from that hamster, running on its little wheel. I make sure to remind all of my new villager friends of this grim fact. I picked up an aquarium for Jeremiah the Frog, dropped it in his lawn, and then stared meaningfully through his windows. I know your secret, Jeremiah. You’re only half a man, and the rest an animal.</p><p>I’m playing Animal Crossing: New Horizons with the mischief of a child. I’m not trying to be malicious. I’m just like a toddler who sees an awesome looking, clearly expensive and elaborate layer cake. And I want to put my hands all up in there. No, I don’t know why. Yes, I’m vaguely aware I’m making someone angry somewhere. No, I won’t stop. Yes, I’m already wrist deep and having a great time.</p>', 'I’m the only one having fun on my Animal Crossing island', 'I am the tyrant of Nook’s domain', '2020-03-26', '14:26:00', 1, 2),
